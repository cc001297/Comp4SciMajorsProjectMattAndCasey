#This is a document detailing the progress being made on the computing project for Matthew Anderson and Casey Cox. Our project involves writing a program that can detect the timing intervals of an adjusatble timing circuit.This project will utilize the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi and will be written using Python. 

#The first github repository used will be gpiozero, found at https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero 

#The timing circuit used is a digital LED relay board timing circuit found at https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Timing-Circuit-Switch-Trigger/dp/B074TBRRTY/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=timing+circuit&qid=1617815030&sr=8-3
#My initial plan will be to use the included button function. When the button is pressed, it will set the voltage to high. The program will then start a timer. The timer will stop when the voltage is set to low. The result will then be printed.

#Example code
```{python}
from gpiozero import Button
from signal import pause
from time import time

def time_start():
    time()
def time_end():
    time()
button = Button(2)

button.when_pressed = time_start
button.when_released = time_end

print['time_start'-'time_end']

pause()
```
