#The purpose of this project is to connect a timing circuit to a Raspberry Pi and use a software program to take precise measurements on the switching of the timing circuit. The timing circuit used is a "DC 6-30V Digital LED Relay Board Cycle Timing Circuit Switch Timer Delay Trigger Module Micro USB 5V" or in less words a cheap Chinese circuit. The GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins on the Pi are used to power the Pi and detect signals from the circuit. These signals are then processed by a Python program to annalyze the time it takes for the circuit to switch on and off.
